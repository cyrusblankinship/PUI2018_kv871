## Visualization of Turnstile Entries at Astoria Blvd. N Station 

![Figure 1](turnstile.png)

#### The MTA collects data on subway ridership by measuring the number of turns (entering and exiting) on each turnstile. Every four hours, each turnstile reports the number of entries and exits recorded over the previous 4 hours. The figure above shows the entry figures for one station, Astoria Blvd. on a Monday (Oct. 29th), in millions of turns. The figure suggests that further exploration of and cleaning of the data is necessary. While it makes intuitive sense that there are more riders entering the subway during the morning hours, the large number for the 8 am reading might indicate that there was more than one reading during that hour.
